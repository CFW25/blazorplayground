# Heading
### Sub-heading
---
This is some sample markdown, with common things like _italics_, **bold**, ~~strikethrough~~, etc...

1. List Item 1
    - unordered sublist item
    - unordered sublist item
2. Item 2 with _**emphasis**_
3. Item 3 with `inline code`

Here's a block of code:
```
var x = 1;
var y = 2;
var sum = x + y;
```

<script>alert('This should be sanitized away...')</script>
